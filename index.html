                <section><p>Today I’ll teach you about a <strong><em>millenary training technique</em></strong> I learned while watching a japanese series named <strong>“Hunter x Hunter”</strong>, which I’m using to assign my study time between different developer topics and improve my&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>##The Basics of&nbsp;Nen</p>
<p><img src="/articles/improve-your-coding-skills-anime/nen1.png" alt="Nen Chart"></p>
<p>First of all, <strong>Hunter x Hunter</strong> is a japanese animated series (Anime) about people that fight a lot and have superpowers, and that’s all you need to know about it. What’s important to us is the <strong>theory</strong> behind their superpowers, which I’m sure they copied from some ancient chinese tradition, as they always&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>In the series, the <strong>(Nen)</strong> (energy) users can train <strong>6 types of abilities</strong> depending mainly on their natural talents. These types are represented in the hexagonal chart above and you can get a general idea of what each type&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>Also, in the series, they propose that <strong>opposite types in the chart can’t be mastered</strong>, but learning them will <strong>greatly benefit</strong> your <strong>main skill</strong>. It also proposes that types <strong>next to each other</strong> are more <strong>closely related</strong> and will be <strong>easier to get to a similar&nbsp;level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens if we apply the concepts to developer&nbsp;training?</strong></p>
<p>##Enter Coder’s&nbsp;Nen</p>
<p><img src="/articles/improve-your-coding-skills-anime/codernen.png" alt="Coder&#39;s Nen">
 
Following the concepts from the previous chart, I made a <strong>coder’s version</strong> covering what I think are the <strong>core skills</strong> for becoming a <strong>good developer</strong>. In this version, however, you are not limited to mastering a single concept, but I tried to place the topics in the best way possible so the closest ones (connecting lines) are more related and the opposite ones are topics that don’t depend on each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p><strong>Now, how does this&nbsp;work?</strong></p>
<p>##Area and High&nbsp;Skills </p>
<p><img src="/articles/improve-your-coding-skills-anime/crisnen.png" alt="My Coder&#39;s Nen"></p>
<p>If you place a <strong>point between the center of the hexagon and the type of skill</strong> being measured, with <strong>center representing 0%</strong> (you don’t know anything about that) and <strong>100% being the point in the hexagon</strong>, and then you <strong>connect all the points</strong>, you get a <strong>polygon</strong> (or line) with the <strong>area representing your “core” value as&nbsp;developer.</strong></p>
<p>In the chart above, I put what I think represents my <strong>current status as developer</strong>. It doesn’t seem much, but if you consider that 100% in Computer Science would be <strong>Donald Knuth</strong> and 100% in Software Engineering would be <strong>Bill Gates</strong>, then it might be even&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>Another way to achieve mastery is focusing only in a main topic and the next ones to it. That would make you a specialist, guru or teacher in certain topic, without necessarily making you lose value because the lesser area being&nbsp;covered.</p>
<p>For the purpose of “becoming a software developer” though, the area approach is&nbsp;better.</p>
<p><strong>Now… How do I use this as a&nbsp;guide?</strong></p>
<p>##Chart as a Guide for Improving your&nbsp;Skills</p>
<p><img src="/articles/improve-your-coding-skills-anime/crisnen2.png" alt="My current goal"></p>
<p>When you ask yourself, “What should I learn next?” Just <strong>draw the chart</strong>, assign values representing at what level you think you are in certain topic and see what skill you want to learn that will also <strong>maximizes the chart area being covered</strong>.</p>
<p>In my case, looking at the chart shows I’m <strong>kind of</strong> weak in “Computer Science” as I studied Electronics Engineering (which also improves my <em>Programming Languages</em> score), so I’m going through some nice books and resources on <strong>Algorithms</strong> and <strong>Data Structures</strong>. Note that improving “Computer Science” just a little has a big impact in the area being covered, and will also help with “Programming languages” and “DevOps”, as much of it has to do with data structures, reasoning and&nbsp;algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Having a good knowledge in all the chart areas will greatly improve your overall value as developer and (in my opinion)&nbsp;employability.</strong></p>
<p>##Final&nbsp;thoughts</p>
<p><img src="/articles/improve-your-coding-skills-anime/crisnen3.png" alt="Projections"></p>
<p>To finish this entry, the last chart reflects my projections for when I “graduate” from FreeCodeCamp, which would also reflect at least the knowledge needed (in total chart area) for a junior-to-mid level developer position (that’s the idea of a Bootcamp&nbsp;right?).</p>
<p>So… <strong>what will you learn today?</strong> Draw the chart and improve your <strong>Coder’s Nen!!</strong> (I should really make an&nbsp;app).</p>

                <section><p>This week, I hit a milestone in my journey as we <a href="http://crisberrios.github.io/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/">finished our first nonprofit project</a> at <span class="caps">FCC</span>. So, until the next project arrives the study goes on, and here’s a recap of what I’ve learned this past two&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>##Focus&nbsp;Switch</p>
<p>Since I’ve been getting a little more confident with my JavaScript skills, I started moving from a 100% pure JavaScript approach to learning some practical skills alongside <span class="caps">JS</span>. Nonetheless, it’s still about 40% pure JS and 60% other things including frameworks, which are (mostly) 100% JS, so JS is still a big part of my daily study. I’ve also started doing some personal projects: there’s a small static site I’m building for a family member (which in turn helped me <a href="https://github.com/crisberrios/static-starter">streamline my frontend workflow</a>) and another small <span class="caps">CRUD</span> project using React and&nbsp;Backbone.</p>
<p>##Resources&nbsp;ahoy!</p>

                  <p class="date"><span>Published on <em>March 31, 2015</em></span></p>
                </header>
                <section><p>A few days ago, we marked our first nonprofit project at <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> as <em>shipped</em>. It was a big milestone (for us and <span class="caps">FCC</span> as its first delivered project) and I feel very happy for being able to deliver a working piece of software, but also because the experience has been great and a first on my career. Kopernik has opened my eyes about how technology, even in its simplest forms, can impact the lives of thousands of people, and how we can be part of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>##FreeCodeCamp</p>
<p><img src="/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/fcc.png" alt="FreeCodeCamp"></p>
<p>First, I’ll do a very, very short review of what FreeCodeCamp&nbsp;does:</p>
<p><span class="caps">FCC</span> is a <strong>free</strong>, online <strong>bootcamp</strong> for aspiring web developers, focused on the <em><span class="caps">MEAN</span></em> stack, and the curriculum has two parts. The first being different free courses found all over the web (soon to be in-house), corresponding to roughly 100 hours, and the second part is making real world projects for nonprofits, which accounts for, also roughly, 900 hours. This way, both <strong><em>campers</em></strong> and nonprofits benefit from the projects, and there’s no money involved in the process. It’s a win/win for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>##Kopernik, Serving the Last&nbsp;Mile</p>
<p><img src="/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/kopernik.png" alt="Kopernik">
 
After finishing the <em>challenges</em> (FreeCodeCamp’s curriculum) I got assigned to a project <strong><strong>(yay!)</strong></strong> along with other fellow <em>camper</em>, Alex. Our project was for a nonprofit called <a href="http://kopernik.info">Kopernik</a>, with operations in many countries of Asia, but in this case it was for the Indonesian branch. What <strong>Kopernik</strong> does is to bring clean technologies to very poor and remote regions of eastern Indonesia, helping women and their families improve their lives and empower them with a business. You can find more watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-uLP1iep6E">this video</a>.</p>
<p>####The&nbsp;problem</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Kopernik to measure the impact of this project and improve our project methodology, we need to record sales data from our agents as well as some data about the end users of the technologies. Later, we interview end users to determine to what extent the technology has improved their&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>However, our sales agents and area coordinators work in regions where access to the internet is limited, unreliable and slow. Users generally have minimal experience with computers and devices. Sales data is gathered from our agents using paper receipts, but getting that data into a format that Kopernik can use create meaningful reports is a complicated&nbsp;process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this project posed many challenges, including inexperienced end-users and adverse conditions for a web app. Ultimately, this problem translated into a data capture app that was able to work offline with automatic uploading when a connection was available, since in the regions described it can go out for weeks. This had us researching a few days before we decided to go with a <strong>Chrome extension</strong>, so we could leverage Chrome local storage and have background services running. We also chose it because a web browser is a familiar interface and enabled us to do automatic updates using the app store. Once this was decided, we were ready to start&nbsp;coding.</p>
<p>##Amber, our <span class="caps">MVP</span>&nbsp;Stakeholder</p>
<p><img src="/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/mvp.gif" alt="MVP"></p>
<p>Our biggest advantage while doing the project was having <strong>Amber</strong> (@amberau at Gitter) as our stakeholder. For starters, she was <strong>super</strong> excited with the project and offered us all the help we needed. She was prompt to get us all the fonts, graphics, requirements, translations and accounts needed as we were making progress. Also, she was very proactive in promoting the project to her colleagues, so we could get as much feedback as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, Amber is a web/software developer with many years of experience, and she was very quick to pinpoint bugs and usability problems. This helped us move forward and ultimately deliver a better app. Furthermore, she always made us feel like a part of Kopernik itself, and we were really happy knowing that this project was going to help their cause. It made me really hope I could work for a nonprofit like this full-time in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>##Challenges and&nbsp;Teachings</p>
<p><img src="/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/learning.gif" alt="Learning"></p>
<p>Of course, one of the ideas of doing a real world project is to have the opportunity of learning and put to practice all the things learned while doing the challenges. On this context, it helped me a lot improving my <span class="caps">HTML</span> and CSS skills, since the form itself is very custom in its format. Trying to get the layout right wasn’t so easy as we thought initially. It also helped me a lot understanding some UX concepts, as we added many visual features and and did many modifications while the project moved forward. Some evenings were spent just reading docs, but the rewards are worth&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>About the challenges we faced, I’d say that more than code-related problems that happen all the time on every project, the big challenge was getting in sync with my partner, as some tasks were interdependent and doing <strong>git merge</strong> sometimes didn’t have the expected result. I also missed pairing a bit more, to be more aligned about what we were doing. But I think that experience also helped us define in a better way the tasks that were being assigned and segment the code so it was easier to work in parallel, a real need in every project in which more than 1 developer is&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>##The&nbsp;Project</p>
<p><img src="/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/form.jpg" alt="Kopernik"></p>
<p>The project consisted of two sub-projects: a frontend app, in the form of a <strong>Chrome extension</strong>, and a Backend app, which exposes an <span class="caps">API</span> endpoint for receiving data sent from the form&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>On the frontend side, there’s the form, using normal <span class="caps">HTML</span> and CSS (no pre-processors), a script for handling network status and transmission of the data, another script for handling storage functions using <strong>Chrome local storage</strong> <span class="caps">API</span> and another script for handling form interactivity and validation. The only <strong>dependency</strong> used was <strong>jQuery 2.1.3</strong> for handling selectors, visual feedback and&nbsp;Ajax.</p>
<p>Also, there is a build step using <strong>Gulp</strong> that minifies <span class="caps">HTML</span>, CSS and JavaScript files, and optimizes images and fonts. The final size of the extension once packed was 85KB including&nbsp;jQuery.</p>
<p>On the backend side, the app uses <strong>Node.js (0.12.1)</strong> with <strong>Express</strong> for the <span class="caps">API</span> endpoint. Received data is validated with an <strong><span class="caps">API</span> key</strong> (for security) and stored into a remote <strong>MongoDB</strong> database using <strong>Mongoose</strong>. A process then retrieves the stored data and converts it into a <strong>.csv</strong> file, which in turn is uploaded to a remote <strong>sFTP</strong> server. In a future, it will have a tighter integration with a <span class="caps">CRM</span>&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>The app itself runs on <strong>Heroku</strong>, and the deployment is handled by <strong>Wercker</strong>, which adds test capabilities (not used yet) to the build and decouples the source repo with Heroku app repo. An additional tool used was adding <strong>New Relic</strong> (free tier) for performance and downtime&nbsp;monitoring.</p>
<p>The source code will be available soon once we make sure no references to the production servers are found in the&nbsp;code.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">TL</span>;DR</strong> we used all the things in bold in our&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>##Final&nbsp;Thoughts</p>
<p><img src="/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/using_app.jpg" alt="girl using the app"></p>
<p>It really fills me with joy being able to be this far with the project and with <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong>. Working with <strong>Kopernik</strong> has been one of my best experience doing a project and I really hope it can help the foundation improve their logistics and reach. Certainly, I want to keep improving the app and adding more features as needed, though I know I’m not required to do&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I also want to thank <strong>Michael</strong> and <strong>Quincy</strong> for giving us the opportunity of doing projects like this and making <span class="caps">FCC</span> better everyday. Lastly, I think that doing projects like this will, undoubtedly, help anyone pursuing a career in web development improve their chances of landing a job in the future, and made me reaffirm I’m on a good path too being a part of this bootcamp. Now, on to the <strong>next project</strong>.</p>
